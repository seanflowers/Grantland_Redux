# Granland_Redux

This was a project to bring back Grantland.com, a sports and popculture website that went defunct in 2015. Bots for each ex-writer would go on the internet (every 4 hours) and look for a new article by the author. The article was checked against a .csv file to see if was new and if so was posed to the subreddit www.reddit.com/r/grantlandredux 

The bots have all gone to sleep now, but this is an example of the code that was used in one of them.# Granland_Redux
